					High School and Middle School robotics teams from across Virginia compete to win a place at the FTC State Championship in March.
					<span class="text-success">This event is free and open to the public. </span>
				</p>
				<p>
					FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) is designed for students who want to compete head to head, using a sports model. Teams of up to 10 students are responsible for designing, building, and programming their own robots to compete in an alliance format against other teams.  Teams, including coaches, mentors and volunteers, are required to develop strategy and build robots based on sound engineering principles. Awards are given for the competition as for well as for community outreach, design, and other real-world accomplishments.
